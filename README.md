# WordMangle

## Introduction

WordMangle is a tool for word / name generation which takes the words supplied in the file
`inputs.txt` and segments them, then stringing matching segments together to generate new
'realistic' words, with likeness to the original inputs.

## Usage

Simply adjust the words within `inputs.txt` and run `main.py` from this directory. The results will
be written to the terminal and the file `outputs.txt`.
